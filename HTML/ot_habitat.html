			<h1>What did T. Rex's home look like?</h1>
			<p>Tyrannosaurus Rex lived around 68-66 million years ago on what is now western North America. Specimens have been found in Montana, Utah, South Dakota, Wyoming and even Canada. T. Rex's enviroment was humid and semi-tropical with woodlands and coastal swamps. Well-watered areas provided a home to many dinosaurs large and small. Flowering plants had begun evolving during this period, although most herbivorous dinosaurus continued to eat ferns and conifers. The abundant distibution of large plant eaters provided much needed food for apex predator Tyrannosaurus Rex. Its presence must have been horrifying to the animals that lived here.</p>

		<h2>A Changing Earth</h2>
		<p>North America was a different looking place during the Cretaceous Period. High sea levels produced a large causeway in the middle of the continent; seperating western land mass (called Laramidia) from eastern Appalachia. As the end of the dinosaur age came to a close 66 million years ago, sea levels began to decline again.</p> <br />
